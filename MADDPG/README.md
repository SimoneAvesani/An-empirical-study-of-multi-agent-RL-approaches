# MADDPG

In this directory there is the new environment called **** where test the MADDPG algorithm.  
The new environment is very similar to the wumpus-dinamic and to use it we need to install python3, gym and tensorflow.
Also we have to download the following repository from github: https://github.com/openai/maddpg and follow all the instruction written in the README file.  
The last step is to put the python file in this directory in multiagent-particle-envs/multiagent/scenarios/ and run it.
